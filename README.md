Collection of utilities for undervolting/underclocking for safe determination and application of efficient voltage-frequency combinations for Ryzen zen2 processors.
It based on Zenstates.py (https://github.com/r4m0n/ZenStates-Linux.git) and uses Benchmarksuit SPEC CPU 2017 (https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/) for checking the stability of the processor.
This tool uses SQLAlchemy for storing the power consumption and the temperature of the CPU with SQLite as database system.
